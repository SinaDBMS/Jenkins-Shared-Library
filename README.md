# Introduction

Due to the Microkernel architecture of Jenkins, itâ€™s essential capabalities are realized by  means of installing
plugins. However in some organizations, firewalls make it nearly impossible  to download the plugins and to keeping them
up-to-date. Other than that, not for every  requirement there is a plugin ready to install. Jenkins suggests shared
libraries to implement user defined functionalities. Unfortunately to test the code, one has to check in the code to VCS
and run the pipeline to see whether the code works or not. This project helps you to perform unit tests using Mockito
on the Groovy Code and to make sure that the implemented functionality works fine before checking anything into VCS.

# Running the project locally

After downloading/cloning the project on your local machine, run the command `mvn test` in your terminal.
you should see there that maven successfully compiles both Java and Groovy files and performs the unit tests
followed by a _BUILD SUCCESS_ status. Of course, you need to have _Maven_ and _Java_ installed on your machine.

# Project structure

The directory structure of this project is as follows:

* **var**: The vars directory hosts Groovy script files that are exposed as a variable in Pipelines. The scripts in this
  directory should act as a layer between the pipeline and the business logic in _src_ directory. Keep the scripts
  here as simple as possible and don't put any business logic here. Otherwise, you loose the benefit of unit testing,
  which is the sole purpose of this project.
  
* **src**: Source code of the Project in Groovy. You should put the business logic of the project here.
* **test**: Unit tests written in Java. To perform unit tests against your groovy classes in _src_, mock Jenkins
  using Mockito.
* **build-scripts**: Contains only the Jenkinsfile of this project. Note that this Pipeline is not an example of a
  pipeline for this project, and it is **not necessary** for the project to run.
