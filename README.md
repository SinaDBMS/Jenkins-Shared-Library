# Introduction

Due to the Microkernel architecture of Jenkins, itâ€™s essential capabalities are realized by means of installing plugins.
However in some organizations, firewalls make it nearly impossible to download the plugins and to keeping them
up-to-date. Other than that, not for every requirement there is a plugin ready to install. Jenkins suggests shared
libraries to implement user defined functionalities. Unfortunately to test the code, one has to check in the code to VCS
and run the pipeline to see whether the code works or not. This project helps you to perform unit tests using Mockito on
the Groovy Code and to make sure that the implemented functionality works fine before checking anything into VCS.

# Running the project locally

After downloading/cloning the project on your local machine, run the command `mvn test` in your terminal. you should see
there that maven successfully compiles both Java and Groovy files and performs the unit tests followed by a _BUILD
SUCCESS_ status. Of course, you need to have _Maven_ and _Java_ installed on your machine.

# Setting up Project in Jenkins

In order to be able to use the implemented functions in _vars_ directory, add the library to your Jenkins server in
_Manage Jenkins -> Configure System_ under _Global Pipeline Libraries_:

# Project structure

The directory structure of this project is as follows:

## var

The vars directory hosts Groovy script files that are exposed as a variable in Pipelines. The scripts in this directory
should act as a layer between the pipeline and the business logic in _src_ directory. Keep the scripts here as simple as
possible and don't put any business logic here. Otherwise, you loose the benefit of unit testing, which is the sole
purpose of this project. Here's an example of a Groovy script that performs a <code>mvn clean install</code>:

```groovy
import de.darian.steps.MavenSteps
import de.darian.core.JenkinsEngine

def call() {
    MavenSteps mvn = new MavenSteps(new JenkinsEngine(this))
    mvn.performMavenCleanInstall()
}
```

In the body of _call_ function an instance of _MavenSteps_ is created. MavenSteps constructor requieres an Instance of
the
_Jenkins_ interface, so that it could delegate the execution of maven commands to a Jenkins node. Here we use the
_JenkinsEngine_ implementation of  _Jenkins_ interface, which would be executed on a Jenkins node. Note that we should
pass a reference of the script to the _JenkinsEngine_ using _this_, so that it could call the relevant Jenkins APIs.
Finally we call the _performMavenCleanInstall_ method of the MavenSteps to build the maven project in the pipeline.

The call method can also accept arguments from the calling pipeline as follows:

```groovy
def call(Map config) {
    String parameter_1 = config.parameter1 as String
    int parameter_2 = config.parameter2 as int
    
    //...
}
```

## src

This directory is similar to Java source directory structure that hosts classes and packages. But the source code in
here is written in Groovy and __NOT__ in Java. You should put the business logic of your code in this directory. This
has two advantages:

* Your Code would become highly structured; You leverage from packages and classes and in turn Object Oriented
  Programming.
* You could easily perform unit tests using Mockito in Java.

_Src_ contains two packages: _core_ and _steps_.

#### core

This package holds _Jenkins_ interface and an implementation of it, _JenkinsEngine_ class. There are already dozens of
functionalities of Jenkins API implemented. Here's a code snippet of JenkinsEngine:

```groovy
package de.darian.core

class JenkinsEngine implements Jenkins {

    private def script

    /**
     *
     * @param script
     */
    JenkinsEngine(def script) {
        this.script = script
    }
    
    @Override
    void echo(String text) {
        this.script.echo(text)
    }
    
    // Other methods ...
}
```

Note that this class holds a reference to the script, from which this code is being called. Therefore always pass a
reference to the pipeline script as explained above in __vars__ section.

#### steps

In this package you could write classes that encapsulate business logics and rely on _Jenkins_ interface to execute code
on Jenkins nodes. An examples of such a step is _MavenSteps_:

```groovy

package de.darian.steps

import de.darian.core.Jenkins


class MavenSteps implements Serializable {

    private Jenkins jenkins

    /**
     *
     * @param jenkins
     */
    MavenSteps(Jenkins jenkins) {
        this.jenkins = jenkins
    }

    /**
     * returns the version of the project which is specified in pom.xml.
     *
     * @return
     */
    String getProjectVersion() {
        String command = 'mvn -q -Dexec.executable=echo -Dexec.args=\'${project.version}\' --non-recursive exec:exec'
        return this.jenkins.sh(command, true, "Maven version")
    }
    
    // Other methods ...

}
```

The <code>getProjectVersion()</code> method of the MavenSteps retrieves the version of the project specified in _
pom.xml_
(e.g. 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT). As you see, the <code>sh</code> method of Jenkins interface is used to execute the command on a
Jenkins node.

You are not restricted to these two packages, infact you need to extend them according to your needs. For example, you
might want to add a _util_ package, which contains helper classes like TextProcessors and so on.

## test

This is the directory where you write your unit tests in Java. There are two packages: _util_ and _steps_. The util
package contains only one class, namely _JenkinsMock_, that implements _Jenkins_ interface. It's the counterpart of
_JenkinsEngine_ in _src_ directory, with the difference that it's only used by test classes to mock Jenkins.

```groovy
package de.darian.util;

import de.darian.core.Jenkins;
import java.util.List;

public class JenkinsMock implements Jenkins {
    
    @Override public String sh(String command, boolean returnStdout, String label) {
        return null;
    }
    
    // Other methods ...
}
```

The other package contains the unit tests and Each class tests its corresponding class in _src_. An example is the class
_CommonStepsTest_. Note that how we use _Mockito_ to mock out Jenkins.

```groovy
package de.darian.steps;

// imports ...

@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
public class CommonStepsTest {

    @Mock
    private JenkinsMock jenkins;

    @BeforeEach
    public void init() {
        MockitoAnnotations.initMocks(jenkins);
    }

    @Test
    public void testSetCurrentBuildDisplayNameToProjectVersion() {
        // Arrange
        CommonSteps commonSteps = new CommonSteps(this.jenkins);
        ArgumentCaptor<String> arg = ArgumentCaptor.forClass(String.class);
        Random rnd = new Random();
        String projectVersion = String.format("%d.%d.%d-SNAPSHOT", rnd.nextInt(20), rnd.nextInt(20), rnd.nextInt(20));
        int currentBuildNumber = rnd.nextInt(200);
        Mockito.when(this.jenkins.sh("mvn -q -Dexec.executable=echo -Dexec.args='${project.version}' " +
                "--non-recursive exec:exec", true, "Maven version")).thenReturn(projectVersion);
        Mockito.when(this.jenkins.getCurrentBuildNumber()).thenReturn(Integer.toString(currentBuildNumber));

        // Act
        commonSteps.setCurrentBuildDisplayNameToProjectVersion();

        // Assert
        Mockito.verify(this.jenkins).setCurrentBuildDisplayName(arg.capture());
        Assertions.assertEquals(String.format("#%d__%s", currentBuildNumber, projectVersion), arg.getValue());
    }

}
```

## build-scripts

This directory contains only the Jenkinsfile of this project. Note that this Pipeline is not an example of a pipeline
for this project, and it is **not necessary** for the project to run.
